Eureka=EUREKA!
eureka.dusterTier0Finished=You start planning all your feature builds but realize you'll need a ton of resources. You also start thinking of a way to make that easier.
eureka.dusterTier1Finished=While processing your ores, you suddenly realize there are more efficient ways to process them.
eureka.dusterTier2-1Finished=After being able to output to inventories you decide to try to see if you can automate the processing itself instead.
eureka.dusterTier2-2Finished=You like that you don't have to jump on the machine, but also want the auto-input/output. You decide to combine your knowledge intro a new machine. Maybe something with lasers?
eureka.kineticToolFinished=While making yet another tool to replace your old one you think of a way to make a tool that won't break
