Eureka=EUREKA!
eureka.dusterTier0Finished=You start planning all your feature builds but realize you'll need a ton of resouces. You also start thinking of a way to make that easier.
eureka.dusterTier1Finished=While processing your ores, you suddenly realize there are more efficient ways to process them.
eureka.dusterTier2-1Finished=After being able to output to inventories you decide to try to see if you can automate the processing itself instead.
eureka.dusterTier2-2Finished=You like that you don't have to jump on the machine, but also want the auto-input/output. You decide to combine your knowledge intro a new machine. Maybe something with lasers?
eureka.kineticToolFinished=While making yet another tool to replace your old one you think of a way to make a tool that won't break

engineeringDiary.Eureka.page0=This book is a Diary of your progress with discovering items and blocks through the Eureka system. As an Engineer, testing and experimentation is required before creating a machine,
engineeringDiary.Eureka.page1=and youâ€™ll need to make and use simple machines in order to have the Eureka moment that leads to new creations. Have fun!
